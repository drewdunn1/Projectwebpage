   <header>How COVID-19 Has Caused Many Stocks To Skyrocket</header> 
        <p>My project is going to focus on how many major tech companies' stocks have skyrocketed in price since COVID-19 hit the U.S. It is most likely due to the fact that we have been indoors way more than usual which leads to us using many technological services at an unusually high rate. Some major examples of stocks that have gone up include Amazon, Apple, Zoom, and many others.</p>
